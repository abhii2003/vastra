                        VASTRA is a counter to the evil fast fashion industry, which creates huge environmental hazards under the pretext of fashion. It might not be a well known fact, but fast fashion is one of the biggest contributors of carbon emission. According to an analysis by Business Insider, fashion production comprises 10% of total global carbon emissions. Fast fashion manufactures clothes that are trendy at present, but are are short lived. Most of these clothes end up in landfills or incinerators after a while, leading to a huge carbon footprint by the fast fashion industry alone. VASTRA is our active effort to reduce this carbon footprint set by the fast fashion industry, by making the same trendy fashion environmentally friendly.
